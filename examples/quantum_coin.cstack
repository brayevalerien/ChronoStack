# Quantum coin flip simulation using branches
# Create multiple timeline branches to simulate superposition

# Initial state
"quantum-coin" tick

# Create heads branch
"heads" branch
1 tick  # heads = 1

# Go back and create tails branch  
"quantum-coin" merge
"tails" branch
0 tick  # tails = 0

# Show both possible outcomes exist in parallel timelines
"quantum-coin" merge
