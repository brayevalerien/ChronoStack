# Paradox example using send
# Creates a causal loop that must be resolved

# Start with initial value
10 tick

# Calculate something based on current value
dup 2 * tick  # 10 * 2 = 20

# Send a different value back in time - creates paradox!
999 2 send

# The interpreter must resolve: 
# - Original timeline had [10] -> [10, 20]
# - But we sent 999 back, so it should be [999] -> [999, 1998]
# - This creates an inconsistency that needs resolution

# Check what actually happened
